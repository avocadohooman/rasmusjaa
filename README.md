### Oh hi ðŸ‘‹
<p>
I'm a student in Hive Helsinki and have previously worked mostly with front end (WordPress), but looking to expand my skills and hope to work with IoT, AI or VR/AR/XR. I love learning new things, technologies and trends and to try and do unconventional and creative things with different techniques.
